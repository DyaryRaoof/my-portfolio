# Dyary's Portfolio

> this is my portfolio website. It includes info about me, how to contact me and my achivemets and creations as a web developer. It's created with CSS and HTML and used VS Code as my code editor. the fonts I used for this website is Poppins and this is for the whole website. I used Flexbox to style my nav items and social media links. I used media queries to make it responsive. so i works well on mobile devices.
